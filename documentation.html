          <p>
            The software aims to streamline the process of collecting,
            aggregating, and analyzing user ratings and reviews for various
            items, such as movies, books, or products. Its primary objectives
            are to enhance user engagement, provide reliable and transparent
            feedback, and support informed decision-making for both users and
            businesses. By offering a centralized platform for ratings and
            reviews, the system aligns with corporate goals of improving
            customer satisfaction, fostering community interaction, and
            leveraging user-generated data for business insights.

          <h3 property="schema:headline">1.5 Project Development Process</h3>
          <p>
            The project was developed collaboratively using GitHub for version
            control, with each team member working on feature branches to ensure
            smooth integration and code review. The development started with the
            implementation of the Categories page, followed by the Entities
            page, and then the Reviews and Q&amp;A sections. Administrative
            features, such as user and content management, were added in later
            stages. This incremental approach allowed for continuous testing and
            refinement of each module before moving on to the next, ensuring a
            stable and well-structured application.

            The "I Rate It" project is a software product designed to provide a
            centralized platform for collecting, aggregating, and analyzing user
            ratings. It is an original solution developed to address the need
            for transparent and reliable feedback in digital marketplaces and
            communities. The diagrams below illustrate the database structure
            and the main components of the system (level 1 of the C4 diagram).

            The software will operate in a local environment (localhost) without
            a dedicated server. It is intended to run on standard personal
            computers or laptops with the following characteristics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardware Platform:</strong> Any modern PC or laptop
              capable of running a web browser and basic local server software
              (e.g., XAMPP).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operating System:</strong> Compatible with Windows 10/11,

            <li>
              <strong>Software Components:</strong> Requires a local web server
              stack such as XAMPP (Apache, PHP, MySQL) for running and testing
              the application.

              It is assumed that users will have access to a modern web browser
              (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) and a compatible operating
              system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
            </li>
            <li>
              The application will be deployed and operated in a local
              environment using XAMPP or a similar local server stack (Apache,
              PHP, MySQL).
            </li>
            <li>
              No third-party or commercial components or APIs are used. The only
              external library used is

                Handlebars.js (via jsDelivr CDN) </a
              >. This helps to render dynamic content in the application and to
              protect against XSS attacks.
            </li>

            <li>
              Security and performance requirements are minimal due to the
              non-production, local deployment context.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any of these assumptions change (e.g., deployment to a public
              server or integration with external APIs), the requirements may
              need to be revised.
