This project was completed in the second year of college, second semester, as part of the Web Technologies course. For this project I worked together with a classmate, and we both had equal involvement in all of the parts. It is a web application (PHP + JavaScript / HTML + CSS / MySQL) that allows users to rate and review items. (More information about the technologies used can be found in the documentation)
